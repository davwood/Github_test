A branch is a way of editing your repository information (files/folders) in a separate area to your normal 'master' branch. So you could create a new 'Updates' branch and work in this area updating your files and committing changes. These changes will be separate to the master.
Later, you could then merge the changes from 'Updates' into the 'master' branch. This will work fine assuming there are no conflicts (that will need manual resolution).
